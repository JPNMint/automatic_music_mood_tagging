Hello :blush:,
here are the dictionaries we talked about. I stored them using the 'pickle' module, I hope that's fine for you. 
gems_items.pkl comprises the 45 items as values with an assignment to the 9 dimensions as keys. synonyms_dict.pkl comprises all sysonyms we found for each of the 45 items. 
If there are any questions, feel free to ask!

Hello! Here is the file with the number of participants that chose a particular item per song (Gs_1 to Gs_47) as well as the total number of items selected per song (sum_selected) and the number of participants that rated the respective song (n_raters). Let me know in case you need any additional data or you have any questions!
